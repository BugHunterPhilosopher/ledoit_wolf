This implementation is based on the paper ["Honey, I shrunk the sample covariance matrix"](http://www.ledoit.net/honey.pdf) by Olivier Ledoit and Michael Wolf, 2003 

Its purpose is to optimize the covariance matrix of asset returns before using it in a portfolio optimizer
to reduce optimization error.
